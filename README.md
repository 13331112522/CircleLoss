# Circle Loss

Pytorch implementation of the paper "Circle Loss: A Unified Perspective of Pair Similarity Optimization"

https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10857



This implementation is still under developement, and I'm not sure if this code consistent with the paper.



# Update

Use CircleLoss in circle_loss.py, and there is a simple example of mnist in mnist_example.py



For pair-wise labels, another implementation https://github.com/xiangli13/circle-loss is suggested.



# Early

Sorry for using master branch as dev. Some early implementations are kept in  circle_loss.py. 



# Other

It has been said that the official implementation will be included in https://github.com/MegEngine.



Thanks very much for Yifan Sun's advice!



Is there something wrong in Eq. 10?
